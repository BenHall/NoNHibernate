# NoNHibernate - Not Only NHibernate
Recently I needed to query the database. Instantly, I started to think about using NHibernate. **Wrong**. NHibernate is amazing! But it's not great if you just want to query a simple table. This is a simple wrapper over ADO.net, combined with AutoMapper and lambda expressions to create a flexible, convention based way to query databases. 

*This will work on .NET 3.5*
